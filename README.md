# Atlas of Everyday Istanbul

**Atlas of Everyday Istanbul** is an interactive digital map built with [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/).  
It was created as part of the **C-LAB Fall 2025 project** “My Istanbul” at Istanbul Bilgi University.

The project invites students to tell stories about the city through places that matter to them.  
Each pin on the map links to a short narrative and one or more media elements (photo, video, or audio ambience).
